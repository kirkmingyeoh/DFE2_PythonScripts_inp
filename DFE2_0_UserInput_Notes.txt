GP
- Specify the GPs as a list in terms of natural coordinates of the macroscale element (optional)
- E.g., GP = [[-3**-0.5,-3**-0.5],[3**-0.5,-3**-0.5],[3**-0.5,3**-0.5],[-3**-0.5,3**-0.5]] for 2D quadrilateral elements with full integration
- E.g., GP = [[0.0,0.0]] for 2D quadrilateral elements with fuly reduced integration
- Leave as '' if not intending to specify, where full integration will be used

Tol 
- Specify the tolerance when performing floating point comparisons (optional)
- Leave as default of 1e-6 or '' if not intending to specify

Sort
- Specify how the macroscale nodes are sorted
- Leave as '' for default, or 'global' or 'user'
